# Interests
While I am most familiar and comfortable with back-end development, I am looking to improve my front-end skillset. I also have experience working on Arduinos and other single-board microcontrollers, mainly for IoT and home automation functions.  

I am currently working on familiarizing myself with PaperMC / Spigot development.
